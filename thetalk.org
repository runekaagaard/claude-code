* Documentation
** CLAUDE.md
- Project instructions that persists across sessions
- Tech stack, modules, conventions, where to find things
- Don't use directory CLAUDE.md's

** llm/[app1.md,app2.md,...]
- Module-specific documentation
- Cross-cutting concerns
- "Be sure to read relevant llm files in the @llm folder"

** Repomix
#+begin_src bash
# Generate with repomix
for app in src/apps/*; do
  appname=$(basename $app)
  repomix --include "$app/**" --style markdown \
    --output "repomix-$appname.md"
  claude -p -c "Read @repomix-$appname.md then follow \
    instructions in @llm/how_to_document_an_app.md and \
    generate llm/$appname.md"
done
#+end_src

** Cross cutting concerns
#+begin_src markdown
Dear Claude:

- please read all the app documentation files in @llm/ and research cross-cutting concerns
- update each llm/[app].md file with these details
#+end_src

* Development setup
- Fast dev environment creation
- Local anonymized databases
- Tests

** Worktrees
- Claude Code conversations are directory specific
- Worktrees over branch switching
- Each task gets isolated directory
- Work on multiple features simultaneously

** Create worktree
#+begin_src bash
git worktree add -b mybranch ~/worktrees/mybranch origin/main
cd ~/worktrees/mybranch
git commit --allow-empty -m "Initial commit"
git push -u origin mybranch
#+end_src

** Workspace creation
- Tmux
- Scripted terminal
- Web UI
- Terminal wrappers

** Workspace creation 2
#+begin_src bash
# Makefile
worktree-setup-symlink:
    ln -sf ~/main/node_modules .
    ...
#+end_src

#+begin_src bash
claude-terminator-workspace ~/worktrees/1234_mybranch/
#+end_src

** /issue command
#+begin_src markdown

* Lets start building stuff
#+begin_src makedown
/issue Please create a new issue for: My Awesome New Feature
#+end_src

* Exploration and Research
- Make Claude use a lot of tokens
- Great way to refresh your own understanding
- Follow up for additional details
- Stepwise approach makes good todo items

** Prompt
#+begin_src markdown
Hi Claude, let's start by researching how [TOPIC] works in the system.

First read:
- The current issue in [PROJECT MANAGEMENT TOOL]
- Any referenced emails
- Relevant documentation in the @llm folder

Then read these core files in full:
- @[FILE_1]
- @[FILE_2]

After that, reference relevant functions in [LONG_FILE] and do additional research as needed.

Finally, summarize your findings.
#+end_src

** Realpath
#+begin_src bash
# Get absolute paths for files
$ realpath [file1] [file2]
#+end_src

#+begin_src elisp
(defun rk-realpath ()
  "Copy the full path of current buffer to kill ring"
  (interactive)
  (kill-new (buffer-file-name))
  (message "Copied: %s" (buffer-file-name)))

(defun rk-realpath-visible-buffers ()
  "Copy a newline separated list of full paths of visible buffers to kill ring."
  (interactive)
  (let ((paths '()))
    ;; Collect paths from all visible buffers
    (dolist (frame (frame-list))
      (dolist (window (window-list frame))
        (let* ((buffer (window-buffer window))
               (path (buffer-file-name buffer)))
          (when path
            (push path paths)))))

    ;; Create newline separated string and kill it
    (let ((paths-str (mapconcat #'identity (delete-dups (nreverse paths)) "\n")))
      (kill-new paths-str)
      (message "Copied %d visible buffer paths" (length (split-string paths-str "\n" t))))))
#+end_src

* Planning
- What are we building?
- How will we build it?
- Ask for questions and answer them
- Don't use plan mode
- "Don't code"

** Prompt
#+begin_src markdown
Today we are building [FEATURE]. I'm thinking we use this overall approach:

- [STEP_1]
- [STEP_2]
- [STEP_3]

Any questions? Feel free to do additional research before we start coding.
#+end_src

#+begin_src markdown
Great questions, I'm thinking the following:

1. [ANSWER_1]
2. [ANSWER_2]
3. [ANSWER_3]

Sounds good? Let's see the code.
#+end_src

* Build the Root
- Very precise language
- Function names and definitions
- Which files are we working in
- We are building the foundational hard parts
- "Keep it simple, zen and to the point"
** Prompt
#+begin_src markdown
Let's build the core foundation. We'll work in these files:
- [FILE_1]
- [FILE_2]

Create a function 

def function_name([param1]: [Type1], [param2]: [Type2]) -> [ReturnType] 

that ...

...

Uh, and we'll need datastructures as well. Please suggest better names, labels and help texts for these before coding the solution.

SomeClass:
   [field1] - int
   [field2] - text, nullable
#+end_src

** Feel
- I'm in control
- I'm not surprised by the output
- Great input → Great output
- With these instructions, I could build this

* Build the Leaves
- Context is now great
- Fill in the blanks
- Let Claude use its knowledge
- Trust the LLM with implementation details
- Great for boilerplate, UI, CRUD, admin interfaces

** Prompt
#+begin_src markdown
Now let's add the admin interface for [MODEL_NAME]. It should have:
- All the standard fields visible
- Filters for [FIELD_1] and [FIELD_2]
- Search functionality
- The usual inline editing for related [RELATED_MODEL]

Also add a [UI_COMPONENT] that displays [DATA] with sorting and pagination. Make it look good and follow the patterns used elsewhere in the project.
#+end_src

** Feel
- I'm delegating the details
- Reaping the benefits of our structured approach
- I trust the output will be sensible
- This is what LLMs are great at

* Commit
#+begin_src bash
clg() {
    unset ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
    claude -p -c "Your task is to commit and push ONLY the uncommitted changes in this git repository.

CRITICAL: You do NOT have access to previous commits in your history. Some changes may already
be committed. You must ONLY work with the uncommitted changes shown by 'git status' and 'git diff'.

WORKFLOW:
1. Run 'git status' to see what files are currently uncommitted (modified/added/deleted)
2. Run 'git diff' to review the actual uncommitted changes
3. Stage these uncommitted changes with 'git add'
4. Create a commit with a single-line descriptive message based ONLY on the uncommitted changes
5. Push the changes with 'git push'

DO NOT reference or include already-committed changes in your commit message.
DO NOT reference the current branch or issue number in the commit message

After successfully completing all steps, output a brief success message and exit immediately.
Do not wait for further instructions or ask any questions.

IMPORTANT TOOL RESTRICTIONS:
- You are ONLY allowed to use these tools:
  * Bash(git status:*) - to check repository status
  * Bash(git diff:*) - to view changes
  * Bash(git add:*) - to stage files
  * Bash(git commit:*) - to commit changes
  * Bash(git push:*) - to push changes
- You are NOT allowed to use any other tools including Read, Write, Edit, Grep, Glob, or any other Bash commands
- Stay focused on the git workflow only" \
    --allowedTools "Bash(git status:*)" "Bash(git diff:*)" "Bash(git add:*)" "Bash(git commit:*)" "Bash(git push:*)"
}
#+end_src

* Cleanup
- Remove LLM idioms and artifacts

** Prompt
#+begin_src markdown
Please clean up the code we just wrote:

- Move all imports to the top of the file
- Remove "before/after" style comments
- Remove placeholder comments like "TODO" or "FIXME" that we've already implemented
- Delete any commented-out old code
- Remove overly verbose comments that explain obvious things
- Consolidate any duplicate code
- Make sure formatting matches the rest of the project

Keep the code functionally identical, just make it look production-ready.
#+end_src

** Feel
- This makes it feel like my code
- Ready to commit
- No evidence of LLM artifacts

* Get feedback
- Compose email
- Update issue
- Ping stakeholders on slack

* Ship It
- Merge PR
- Update and close issue
