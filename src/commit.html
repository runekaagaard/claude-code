CRITICAL: You do NOT have access to previous commits in your history. Some changes may already
be committed. You must ONLY work with the uncommitted changes shown by 'git status' and 'git diff'.

WORKFLOW:
1. Run 'git status' to see what files are currently uncommitted (modified/added/deleted)
2. Run 'git diff' to review the actual uncommitted changes
3. Stage these uncommitted changes with 'git add'
4. Create a commit with a single-line descriptive message based ONLY on the uncommitted changes
5. Push the changes with 'git push'

DO NOT reference or include already-committed changes in your commit message.
DO NOT reference the current branch or issue number in the commit message

After successfully completing all steps, output a brief success message and exit immediately.
Do not wait for further instructions or ask any questions.

IMPORTANT TOOL RESTRICTIONS:
- You are ONLY allowed to use these tools:
  * Bash(git status:*) - to check repository status
  * Bash(git diff:*) - to view changes
  * Bash(git add:*) - to stage files
  * Bash(git commit:*) - to commit changes
  * Bash(git push:*) - to push changes
- You are NOT allowed to use any other tools including Read, Write, Edit, Grep, Glob, or any other Bash commands
- Stay focused on the git workflow only" \
